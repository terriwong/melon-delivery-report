<p>We can make a function that each of the days can re-use.</p>
<p>We'll pass the function the day number and the filename to use
for that day, and it will produce a report for that day.</p>
<div class="section" id="code">
<h1>Code</h1>
<pre class="literal-block">
def melon_count(day_number, path):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Given day number &amp; path to the deliveries, produce report.

    Opens the deliveries file at [path], processes each line,
    and generates report in all uppercase.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    print &quot;Day&quot;, day_number
    delivery_log = open(path)

    for line in delivery_log:
        line = line.rstrip()
        words = line.split('|')

        melon = words[0]
        count = words[1]
        amount = words[2]

        # or you could do this with &quot;list unpacking&quot;:
        #
        # melon, count, amount = words
        
        print &quot;Delivered {} {}s for total of ${}&quot;.format(
            count, melon, amount)

    delivery_log.close()


melon_count(1, &quot;um-deliveries-20140519.txt&quot;)
melon_count(2, &quot;um-deliveries-20140520.txt&quot;)
melon_count(3, &quot;um-deliveries-20140521.txt&quot;)

<p>We're using a &quot;docstring&quot;--that long string right after the
function declaration. That is there to explain what the function
does. It's a bit like a comment, but its job is to explain the
<em>purpose</em> of the function, not to describe how it works.</p>
<p>Also, we could handle pulling of the fields out in either of two
ways:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# By explicit indexing
melon = words[0]
count = words[1]
amount = words[2]

# By &quot;list unpacking&quot;
melon, count, amount = words
</pre>
<p>When the number of items in a list matches the number of variables
you'd like to extract, the second method is often shorter, prettier,
and easy to use.</p>
