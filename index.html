<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>URGENT</em> Report needed for CEO!

Hey there,

We've been trying to send the melon delivery report to the CEO, but
something is broken with the script. The guy who started it has now
left to start his own startup, Squysh (&quot;Lyft for Winter Squash&quot;) and
you're the only developer left on the team that knows python.

We log this delivery information in a text file that has the following
format::

  Melon Name | Count Sold | Total Amount Sold in $

The script is printing the name of the melon where the count and
totals should be. I'm hoping you can help! We need to deliver this
report ASAP!

I've attached the code we have so far in the file <cite>produce-summary.py</cite>
along with delivery logs for the last three days.

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead

Hey great job so far, the CEO really appreciated that report.

One more thing---I think the code is a little hard to read because
there's so much going on. I would appreciate it if you could do
your best to clean up the code and remove any repetition by
defining some function calls. That should make it easier to read
and run in the future.

Sincerely,
Mel
